    #
    # Measured accuracy by config (gemini-3-flash-preview, reasoning=medium):
    #   v16  6D, 6 hints, digit-set fully revealed (all hints = secret perms) 68%
    #   v18  5D, ~4 hints, info-greedy, no reveal -> 72%   (easy: on target)
    #   v18  6D, ~4 hints, info-greedy, no reveal -> 15%
    #   v19  6D, ~7 hints (extra_hints=3), no reveal -> 14%  (redundancy = NO effect)
    #   v19  6D, ~5 hints (extra_hints=1), no reveal -> 12%
    #
    # Lessons:
    #   - Redundant hint count does NOT move accuracy (v19 14% == v18 15%).
    #   - num_digits is a CLIFF: 5D no-reveal=69-72%, 6D no-reveal=12-15%. The
    #     50%/25% targets fall in that gap, so digit count alone can't hit them.
    #   - The real lever is the DIGIT SET. Figuring out *which* digits the secret
    #     uses is the hard part; once known it's just an arrangement. But the
    #     model only exploits that when it's stated explicitly (a lone
    #     strikes+balls==N hint buried among random ones did nothing in v19).
    #
    # v20 lever: `revealed_digits` — state j of the secret's digits explicitly in
    # the prompt ("contains these digits, positions unknown"); the rest must be
    # deduced. j tunes difficulty continuously between no-reveal (~14%) and
    # full-reveal arrangement (~68%) on 6D. easy stays 5D no-reveal.
    #
    # NOTE: earlier score swings were an ENV bug (eval run without .venv), NOT a
    # model change. With .venv active the model is stable, so this calibration
    # will hold. Trustworthy no-reveal baseline (.venv, gemini-3-flash-preview):
    #   5D = 96% · 6D = 89% · 7D = 62%   (8D measured this round)
    # All above target -> need HARDER. reveal only EASES and digits jump coarsely
    # (~-27%p per step), so the strategy is: overshoot hardness with +1 digit
    # (accuracy below target), then ease back up with revealed_digits.
    #
    # v24:
    #   easy   7D, j=2  -> aim 75% (7D no-reveal=62%, reveal eases up)
    #   medium 8D, j=3  -> aim 50% (8D no-reveal ~25-35%, reveal eases up)
    #   hard   8D, j=0  -> aim 25% (8D no-reveal ~25-35%)
    # reveal magnitude on 7-8D in this env is unmeasured -> tune after next eval
